 This is a simply portfolio website, contains:
 - Various projects I'm working on
 - Contact information
 - And information about myself

---

At the moment it is very simple, but I hope to add to it as I learn more about web development.

The next addition will hopefully be a section utilizing the Spotify API in order to show what I'm currently listening to.

Later on I may try to add a section for blog posts and maybe a built in simple game or something. Only time will tell.
